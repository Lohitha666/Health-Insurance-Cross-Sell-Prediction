# 🏥 Health Insurance Cross-Sell Prediction  

## 📌 Overview  
The **Health Insurance Cross-Sell Prediction** project leverages machine learning to predict whether an existing health insurance customer is likely to purchase a vehicle insurance policy. By analyzing customer demographics, past policies, and behavioral data, the model provides insights to improve cross-selling strategies.  

## 🚀 Getting Started  
Follow the steps below to download, set up, and run the project on your local machine.  

# 1️⃣ Prerequisites  
Ensure you have the following installed:  
- Python 3.8+  
- Pandas & NumPy for data processing  
- Scikit-learn for machine learning  
- Matplotlib & Seaborn for data visualization  
- Jupyter Notebook (optional for interactive analysis)  

# 2️⃣ Clone the Repository  
```sh  
git clone https://github.com/your-username/repo-name.git  
cd repo-name  
```

# 3️⃣ Install Dependencies  
```sh  
pip install -r requirements.txt  
```

# 4️⃣ Data Preparation  
1. Place the dataset in the `data/` directory.  
2. Ensure the dataset follows the expected format:  
   | Customer_ID | Age | Gender | Driving_License | Previously_Insured | Vehicle_Age | Vehicle_Damage | Policy_Sales_Channel | Annual_Premium | Response |  
   |------------|-----|--------|----------------|------------------|------------|---------------|---------------------|--------------|---------|  

# 5️⃣ Train the Model  
To train the prediction model, run:  
```sh  
python train.py  
```
This will preprocess the data, train the machine learning model, and save it for future use.  

# 6️⃣ Make Predictions  
To predict whether a customer is likely to purchase vehicle insurance, run:  
```sh  
python predict.py --input customer_data.csv  
```
